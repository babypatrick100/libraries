This is useful for adding injection systems or\\nextending the behavior of components by wrapping around\\ncomponent lifecycle methods.\\n\\nThe `shouldConstruct` function can be used to indicate\\nif the component should actually be created. This must\\nreturn `true` or `false`.

This can be used in\\norder to toggle an extension on/off depending on whatever\\nlogic is appropriate. If no `shouldExtend` function is\\nprovided, the extension will always be used if provided\\nas an extension to the component.\\n\\nAs an example, an extension could be created to simply log\\nwhen the various lifecycle stages run on the component:\\n\\n```lua\\nlocal Logger = {}\\nfunction Logger.constructing(component, componentClass) print(\\"constructing\\", component) end\\nfunction Logger.constructed(component, componentClass) print(\\"constructed\\", component) end\\nfunction Logger.starting(component, componentClass) print(\\"starting\\", component) end\\nfunction Logger.started(component, componentClass) print(\\"started\\", component) end\\nfunction Logger.stopping(component, componentClass) print(\\"stopping\\", component) end\\nfunction Logger.stopped(component, componentClass) print(\\"stopped\\", component) end\\n\\nlocal MyComponent = Component.new({tag = \\"MyComponent\\", extensions = {Logger}})\\n```\\n\\nSometimes it is useful for an extension to control whether or\\nnot a component should be constructed. For instance, if a\\ncomponent on the client should only be instantiated for the\\nlocal player, an extension might look like this, assuming the\\ninstance has an attribute linking it to the player\'s UserId:\\n```lua\\nlocal player = game:GetService(\\"Players\\").LocalPlayer\\n\\nlocal OnlyLocalPlayer = {}\\nfunction OnlyLocalPlayer.shouldConstruct(component)\\n\\tlocal ownerId = component.instance:GetAttribute(\\"OwnerId\\")\\n\\treturn ownerId == player.UserId\\nend\\n\\nlocal MyComponent = Component.new({tag = \\"MyComponent\\", extensions = {OnlyLocalPlayer}})\\n```\\n\\nIt can also be useful for an extension itself to turn on/off\\ndepending on various contexts.
